# Unit19-Cryptocurrency-Wallet

I work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

I have built the platform and below sharing the detials with screnshots.

This is a demonstration from platform page that I chose Ash and assigned him 5 hours. His total wage would be 1.65 ether. I clicked on **Send Transaction** .

I open Ganache and navigate to transactions page. I have 3 transactions and the last transaction is me paying Ash. I open that transaction details.

As you can see from transaction details I sent Ash's wallet 1.65 ether.
